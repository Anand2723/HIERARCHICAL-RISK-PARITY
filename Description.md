# Preface 
The following is a project on a relatively new method of portfolio optimisation - Hierarchichal Risk Parity. 
This technique has three sub-parts namely - "Tree Clustering", "Quazi-Diaganolization" and "Recursive Bisection".
# Motive 
This technique being a completlely different one than the comtemporary methods of portfolio optimisation, allowed me to learn a lot and helped me to get a better look on the problems that a quantitative researcher has to face in real life.
# Results 
I have used various other models of portfolio optimisation like minimum variance method and method of uniform weights to compare the outputs of this technique, by which I fount that this model worked much better than the comtemporary ones.
